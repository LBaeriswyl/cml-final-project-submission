# cml-final-project-submission

This is the repository of our code submission for Cloud and ML.
We have collected here the scripts we have used and edited to enable memory profiling of LoRA and QLoRA on Stable Diffusion (and Llama), primarily leveraging huggingface diffusers and the LyCORIS codebases.

This repository features a collection of notebooks, configs, as well as some of the changes made to the libraries.
